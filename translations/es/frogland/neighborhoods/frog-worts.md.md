# ðŸª„ Frog Worts

If you are looking to get involved with the arcane, alchemy and other arts of a dark and dubious nature, Frog Worts is the area you'll feel right at home in.&#x20;

Frogs like to hang out in the Hexagon, the local pub for all frogs interested in the arcane. Spirits and Elixirs is the local apothecary, home of all your potion-making, spell-casting, and herb having needs.&#x20;

Madame Chiripa is known to hang around these parts, and she is not a frog to be trifled with!
