# ðŸ›– Gangs, Guilds, & Groups

### Nazar Frogs

A collective of seven frogs in the community with their own goals and ideas of how to make their run of good karma in a casino into much, much more. Running the Aquatica Casino in Frogland, these frogs are known to have many fingers in many fly pies throughout the government.&#x20;

### Nude Frog Club

A group of frogs centered around their lack of clothing and their origin story in the hot springs in the Frogland plateau, all recorded in _The Book of the Naked Frog_ - a text written by their own.&#x20;

### Real PADwives of Frogland

The source of all things feminine, froggy, and powerful in Frogland, these ladies are here to empower other women in the space, both as frogs and as humans.&#x20;

### The HipHOP Anonymous Gang

Sappo Studioâ€™s, located near the center of Frogland, acts as home base for the Notorious HipHOP Anonymous Gang. Although some speculate that Sappo Studios serves as a front for the infamous gangâ€™s illegal activities, no one has been able to pin anything on the founders.&#x20;

### Dragonfly Gang

Based around the trait of having a dragonfly on your frog, the Dragonfly Gang finds their home in the center of a lagoon, surrounded by all flowers that dragonflies enjoy.&#x20;

### Magic Guild

The founding frogs of the Magic Guild have been consumed with understanding the deeper meaning besides the Frogs' strange and alien appearance in Frogland. They decided to take their chances on the periphery of the land and venture out to the edge of the swamp, going west toward the setting sun.

### Webbed Pete Gang

The Webbed Pete Gang runs the famously addictive taco truck in town. Some say that the secret ingredient is the "sugar" "imported" "legally" from across the border...and those people seem to have a very persistent cold.&#x20;

### Mantis Gang

The Mantis Gang has a deep rivalry with the Dragonfly Gang, stemming all the way back to...well, no one is quite sure anymore, but the grudge runs deep.

### The RifRaf

These rabble rousing frogs prefer living life on the streets than the pretentious flash and haze of the upper class, preferring to stay true to their hip-hop roots.&#x20;

### Peacocky Blinders

These frogs are the only ones in Frogland to have forged an alliance with the Pangea Peacocks, affording them a certain level of protection from dangerous and sealed lands of the Peacocks. This alliance is memorialized in the iconic headdresses worn by the frogs of Peacocky Blinders.&#x20;

### The Prison Gang

It's rumored that the members of the Prison Gang have some backhanded dealings with the speakeasy in town, Double Barrell. Even whilst operating Bullish Laundromat, a business that employs ex-con frogs, these frogs wear their stripes proudly as they endeavor to show that they shortened their time by working their way out of jail.&#x20;
