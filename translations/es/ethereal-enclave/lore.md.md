# ðŸ“œ Lore

The 0N1 Force are 7,777 generative side-profile characters with over 100 hand-drawn features fighting for their existence. Strength, spirit, and style are what you'll need to survive in the Ethereal Enclave.&#x20;

### Backstory

Life in the Ethereal Enclave was peaceful and prosperous. Rule under the emperor granted eternal life; infinite leisure for music, arts, and poetry.&#x20;

For many, this was bliss, but when the emperor suddenly died without an heir, everything collapsed.&#x20;

What was once everlasting has now been condensed to a mere 7,777 hours.&#x20;

Now, gathering means for survival as society crumbles, the 0N1 face their greatest enemies...themselves.
