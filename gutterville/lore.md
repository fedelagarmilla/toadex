## Gutter Cats

The year is 2050. Humans are an interplanetary species and have all but abandoned the post-apocalyptic shatters of society on earth. Cats have taken over. One crime-ridden, nondescript inner city is inhabited by a group of cats collectively known as the Gutter Cats. This is their story.

## Gutter Rats

Far underground, in the bowels of the Autonomous Zone, the Gutter Rats roam, sustaining themselves on the decaying crumbs of the extravagant lifestyles above. Discontent with their subservient position in the Gutter, the conniving rats lie in wait, scheming to one day claim the throne from the Gutter Cat Gang.

## Gutter Pigeons

With a bird’s-eye view of the Autonomous Zone, the Gutter Pigeons keep their claws on the pulse of the power dynamics below. Purveyors of misinformation and peddlers of mistrust, the Pigeons, known as the “Rats of the Sky” in the Gutter, have created an intricate smuggling network to transport contraband, news, and rumors into the streets.

## Gutter Dogs

No longer able to rely on the crutch of “man’s best friend” or live in their nice suburban homes, the Gutter Dogs had to move to the inner city and reinvent themselves as “tough guys”. Now, the Dogs spend their days flexing, fighting, and hustling in the streets to make ends meet, trying to figure out a way to make it to the top.
