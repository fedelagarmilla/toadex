# üìú Lore

The Notorious Frogs were transported an alien device found in the woods on Earth into NewPangea, where they established their home, Frogland, on a central plateau. There are remnants of some kind of alien species that had been living on NewPangea, appearing to have been abandoned in some sort of rush and then left to fall into a state of disrepair.

The Notorious Frogs had been trapped in their earthly bodies by some unknown force, cursed to live an eternal life but in a constant state of lethargy, unable to live their wildest dreams. When transported to NewPangea, they returned to their true selves: intelligent, adept, and filled with a furious desire to PARTY!!&#x20;

The lack of any desire to police or abide by any laws have made these 10,000 frogs a relatively lawless bunch, though many Frogs try to live up to the positive connotation of ‚Äúnotorious‚Äù rather than the negative. The FLPD is pretty useless, being more interested in catching flies than criminals. The Frogland Bureau of Instigations (FBI) is more intent on solving crimes and taking bribes‚Ä¶provided they‚Äôre sizable enough.
