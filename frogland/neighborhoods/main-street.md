# üè™ Main Street

Home to several stores, a few bars, and other businesses, Main Street is the most hoppening place to be for all those fly-brow frogs.&#x20;

Hang out at The Dragonfly, serving up the best drinks and entertainment in town.

Or take a stroll around the Town Square, where rumors are traded, illegal street racing occurs, and anything can be overheard‚Ä¶

Take your loved frog around to the Gardens, where gossip take root in this rich soil, watered by the blood of dying chickens the illegal cock fighting rings leave behind while hopping madly away from the protective tender of these luscious gardens. If you garner his favor, maybe he'll give you one in return.

Kings Ave is a new street under development, where you can head to Zooz Main Stage and catch the best frogging performances in town! Head over to Zooz Bar afterwards for a stiff drink and great laughs.
