# 🎮 Discord

Good ribbit and welcome to NewPangea! We want to make your transition a smooth one. Below find an ever-updating list of subheadings, their channels, and their purpose. Make sure to check out the **pinned posts** (pushpin icon top R side on desktop, swipe to R sidebar on mobile) as they will have key information for each channel.
